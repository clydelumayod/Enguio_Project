# Immediate Transfer System

This document explains the implementation of the immediate transfer system for convenience stores and pharmacies in the Enguio Project.

## Overview

The immediate transfer system allows warehouse managers to transfer products to specific stores (convenience store or pharmacy), and the products are automatically added to the destination store's inventory immediately without requiring notifications or manual acceptance.

## Features

### 1. Immediate Product Transfer
- When a transfer is created from warehouse to convenience store or pharmacy, products are immediately added to the destination location
- No notifications or manual acceptance required
- Products appear in the destination store's inventory immediately
- Transfer status is automatically set to "Completed"

### 2. Real-time Inventory Updates
- Products are immediately available in destination stores
- Stock status is automatically calculated based on quantities
- Real-time inventory tracking across all locations

### 3. Simplified Workflow
- No notification system required
- No manual acceptance process
- Direct transfer from warehouse to stores
- Immediate availability of products

## Database Setup

The system uses the existing database structure with the following key tables:

### Locations
- Location ID 2: Warehouse (source)
- Location ID 3: Pharmacy (destination)
- Location ID 4: Convenience Store (destination)

### Products
- Products are stored with location_id to track which store they belong to
- Stock status is automatically calculated (in stock, low stock, out of stock)

## Workflow

### 1. Warehouse Manager Creates Transfer
1. Go to Inventory Transfer page
2. Select source (warehouse) and destination (convenience store/pharmacy)
3. Select products and quantities
4. Submit transfer
5. Products are immediately added to destination store inventory

### 2. Store Managers See Products Immediately
1. Products appear in store inventory immediately after transfer
2. No manual acceptance required
3. Stock levels are updated automatically
4. Products are ready for sale

## Components Updated
