# Convenience Store Transfer Bug Fix

## Problem Description
When transferring products from warehouse to convenience store, the products were not showing up in the convenience store inventory. Instead, they appeared to remain in the warehouse or disappeared entirely.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `create_transfer` action in `Api/backend.php`. The problematic logic was:

1. ✅ Correctly reduced quantity in source location
2. ❌ **BUG**: Deleted entire product record when quantity became 0 or less
3. ✅ Correctly created/updated product in destination location  
4. ❌ **PROBLEM**: Transfer details referenced deleted `product_id`, breaking transfer history

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed Product Deletion Issue
**File**: `Api/backend.php` (lines ~1120-1140)

**Before** (Problematic):
```php
// If quantity is 0 or less, remove the product from source location
if ($remainingQty && $remainingQty['quantity'] <= 0) {
    $deleteSourceStmt = $conn->prepare("
        DELETE FROM tbl_product 
        WHERE product_id = ? AND location_id = ?
    ");
    $deleteSourceStmt->execute([$product_id, $source_location_id]);
}
```

**After** (Fixed):
```php
// If quantity is 0 or less, mark as out of stock but keep the record
// DO NOT DELETE the product record as it breaks transfer references
if ($remainingQty && $remainingQty['quantity'] <= 0) {
    $updateStockStmt = $conn->prepare("
        UPDATE tbl_product 
        SET stock_status = 'out of stock',
            quantity = 0
        WHERE product_id = ? AND location_id = ?
    ");
    $updateStockStmt->execute([$product_id, $source_location_id]);
}
```

### 2. Fixed Status Enum Inconsistency
**File**: `Api/backend.php`

**Before**: Using `'Completed'` status (not in database enum)
**After**: Using `'approved'` status (matches database enum: pending, approved, rejected)

### 3. Updated Frontend Status Handling
**File**: `app/Inventory_Con/InventoryTransfer.js`

- Updated transfer creation to use `'approved'` status
- Fixed status display logic to handle database enum values
- Updated transfer statistics to use correct status values

### 4. Improved Product Query Logic
**File**: `Api/backend.php` - `get_products` action

Added logic to exclude out-of-stock products when not filtering by specific location, while still showing all products when viewing a specific location's inventory.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Current Inventory Status
1. Go to Warehouse inventory page
2. Note available products and quantities
3. Go to Convenience Store inventory page  
4. Check current products (if any)

### 2. Perform Transfer Test
1. Navigate to Inventory Transfer page
2. Click "Create Transfer"
3. Select:
   - Original Store: **Warehouse**
   - Destination Store: **Convenience**
4. Select products with available quantity
5. Set transfer quantities (≤ available quantity)
6. Complete the transfer

### 3. Verify Results
1. **Warehouse**: Product should remain with reduced quantity (or 0 if fully transferred)
2. **Convenience Store**: Product should appear with transferred quantity
3. **Transfer History**: Should show completed transfer with all details

### 4. Check Transfer Details
1. In Transfer History, click on the transfer to expand details
2. Verify all transferred products are listed correctly
3. Check that total values are calculated properly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Transfer Scenario:
- **Source (Warehouse)**: Product quantity reduced by transfer amount
- **Destination (Convenience)**: Product appears with transferred quantity
- **Transfer Record**: Complete transfer details maintained
- **Status**: Shows as "Completed" (approved status)

### Database Integrity:
- Product records preserved (not deleted)
- Transfer references remain valid
- Stock status properly updated
- Location-specific inventory accurate

## Database Schema Notes

### Location IDs:
- `2` = Warehouse
- `3` = Pharmacy  
- `4` = Convenience

### Transfer Status Values:
- `pending` = Awaiting approval
- `approved` = Completed transfer (shows as "Completed" in UI)
- `rejected` = Cancelled transfer

### Product Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `tbl_product` (
  `product_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `location_id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `quantity` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `stock_status` varchar(20) DEFAULT 'in stock',
  -- other fields...
);
```

## Testing Commands (if database connection available)

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
php test_convenience_transfer_fix.php
```

Or manually test through the web interface following the verification steps above.

## Troubleshooting

### If products still don't show in convenience store:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
3. Check PHP error logs for backend issues
4. Ensure database connection is working

### If transfer fails:
1. Verify sufficient quantity in source location
2. Check that both locations exist and are valid
3. Ensure employee is selected for transfer
4. Check transfer validation logic

## Files Modified
- `Api/backend.php` - Main transfer logic fixes
- `app/Inventory_Con/InventoryTransfer.js` - Frontend status handling
- `test_convenience_transfer_fix.php` - Verification script (created)

The fix ensures proper inventory management while maintaining data integrity and transfer history.
