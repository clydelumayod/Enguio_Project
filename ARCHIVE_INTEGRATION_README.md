# Archive System Integration

## Overview
The archive system has been successfully integrated across all inventory components (Warehouse, Pharmacy, and Convenience Store). When items are archived from any location, they are automatically moved to the dedicated archive table and can be managed through the Archive page.

## Components Connected

### 1. Warehouse Inventory (`Warehouse.js`)
- **Archive Button**: üì¶ icon in the Actions column
- **Functionality**: Archives products and suppliers
- **Archive Reason**: "Archived from warehouse management"
- **Location**: Products in warehouse location

### 2. Pharmacy Inventory (`PharmacyInventory.js`)
- **Archive Button**: üì¶ icon in the Actions column  
- **Functionality**: Archives pharmacy products
- **Archive Reason**: "Archived from pharmacy inventory"
- **Location**: Products in pharmacy location

### 3. Convenience Store (`ConvenienceStore.js`)
- **Archive Button**: üì¶ icon in the Actions column
- **Functionality**: Archives convenience store products
- **Archive Reason**: "Archived from convenience store inventory"
- **Location**: Products in convenience store location

### 4. Archive Management (`Archive.js`)
- **View**: All archived items from all locations
- **Restore**: Restore items back to their original location
- **Delete**: Permanently delete archived items
- **Filter**: Search and filter by type, date, etc.

## How It Works

### Archiving Process
1. User clicks the archive button (üì¶) on any product/supplier
2. Confirmation modal appears
3. User confirms the archive action
4. System:
   - Updates the item's status to 'archived' in the original table
   - Creates a new record in `tbl_archive` with all item details
   - Stores the original data as JSON for restoration purposes
   - Records who archived it, when, and why

### Archive Table Structure
```sql
tbl_archive (
  archive_id (Primary Key)
  item_id (Original item ID)
  item_type (Product/Category/Supplier)
  item_name
  item_description
  category
  archived_by
  archived_date
  archived_time
  reason
  status (Archived/Deleted/Restored)
  original_data (JSON)
  created_at
)
```

### Restoration Process
1. User goes to Archive page
2. Clicks restore button on archived item
3. System:
   - Updates the original item's status back to 'active'
   - Updates archive record status to 'Restored'
   - Item reappears in its original location

## API Endpoints

  "product_id": 123,
  "reason": "Archived from [location]",
  "archived_by": "admin"
}
```
