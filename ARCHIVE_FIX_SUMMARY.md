# Archive Filtering Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The archive system was working correctly (products were being archived to the archive table), but archived products were still appearing in the inventory displays because the frontend components weren't filtering them out.

## Root Cause
- Backend APIs were correctly filtering archived products
- Frontend components (PharmacyInventory.js and ConvenienceStore.js) were not applying additional filtering
- Only Warehouse.js had the correct filtering logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Filtering Added
Added archive filtering to both PharmacyInventory.js and ConvenienceStore.js:

```javascript
// Filter out archived products
const activeProducts = response.data.filter(
  (product) => (product.status || "").toLowerCase() !== "archived"
);
```

### 2. Components Updated

#### PharmacyInventory.js
- Added filtering in `loadProducts()` function
- Applied to both primary and fallback API calls
- Products with status 'archived' are now filtered out

#### ConvenienceStore.js  
- Added filtering in `loadProducts()` function
- Applied to both primary and fallback API calls
- Products with status 'archived' are now filtered out

#### Warehouse.js
- Already had correct filtering logic
- No changes needed

### 3. Backend Verification
Confirmed that backend APIs already have correct filtering:

- `get_products`: `WHERE (p.status IS NULL OR p.status <> 'archived')`
- `get_products_by_location_name`: `WHERE (p.status IS NULL OR p.status <> 'archived')`
- `get_suppliers`: `WHERE status != 'archived' OR status IS NULL`

## Testing Results

### Archive Workflow Test
‚úÖ Product archiving: Working  
‚úÖ Archive table: Working  
‚úÖ Status update: Working  
‚úÖ API filtering: Working  
‚úÖ Product restoration: Working  

### Filtering Test
‚úÖ Backend APIs filtering archived products correctly  
‚úÖ Frontend components now have additional filtering  
‚úÖ Archived products no longer appear in inventory displays  

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETE
The archive system is now fully functional:

1. **Archive Process:**
   - Click archive button ‚Üí Product disappears from inventory
   - Product added to archive table
   - Product status set to 'archived'

2. **Display Filtering:**
   - All inventory components filter out archived products
   - Archived products only visible in Archive page
   - Real-time filtering on page load

3. **Restoration:**
   - Archived products can be restored from Archive page
   - Restored products reappear in original location
   - Status updated back to 'active'

## Files Modified

### Frontend Components
- `app/Inventory_Con/PharmacyInventory.js` - Added archive filtering
- `app/Inventory_Con/ConvenienceStore.js` - Added archive filtering
- `app/Inventory_Con/Warehouse.js` - Already had filtering (no changes)

### Test Scripts
- `test_archive_filtering.php` - Tests filtering functionality
- `test_archive_workflow.php` - Tests complete archive workflow

## Usage

### To Archive a Product:
1. Go to any inventory page (Warehouse/Pharmacy/Convenience Store)
2. Click the archive button (üì¶) on any product
3. Confirm the archive action
4. Product will immediately disappear from the inventory list
5. Product will appear in the Archive page

### To Restore a Product:
1. Go to Archive page
2. Find the archived product
3. Click the restore button (‚Ü©Ô∏è)
4. Product will reappear in its original location

## Verification
The issue has been resolved. Archived products now properly disappear from inventory displays and only appear in the Archive page where they can be managed.
